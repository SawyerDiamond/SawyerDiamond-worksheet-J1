1. Fault localization is the process in which a developer identifies the part of whatever code has been written is causing an **incorrect output**.

2. The three benefits of TDD

- Tests aren't biased
- It may inform how you approach writing the code
- Helps you consider the requirements of your system

  3).

* Length
  - Less than 8 characters
  - 8 characters exactly
  - < 8 characters
* Character Composition
  - Contains only numbers
  - Contains only uppercase letters
  - Contains only lowercase letters
  - Contains numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters
  - Contains numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and underscores
* Words that may be prohibited
  - Contains "gmail"
  - Does not contain "gmail"

4. Truth Table

| a > b | G   | x < y | Predicate Outcome | Clause Responsible |
| ----- | --- | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| F     | F   | F     | F                 | x < y              |
| F     | F   | T     | F                 | G or a > b         |
| T     | F   | T     | T                 | G                  |
| F     | T   | T     | T                 | a > b              |

5. Nodes
   ```
    1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
    1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 7
    1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
    1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

6. [Mutation testing](https://cs2113-f24.github.io/j/software_testing) is preferable to other testing methods as it assesses the effectiveness of test cases. It introduces faults through fault seeding into the code to ensure that tests can detect errors, which leads to a system that evaluates test quality rather than just code coverage or input scenarios.

7) Test case that found the bug:

```python
"checkCode 900.HI 45309",
	"true",
```
